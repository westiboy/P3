##Description of the project##
This project is basically a random generator. It has two important parts:

 * A Lorem Ipsum generator

   Lorem Ipsum is gibberish Latin used by designers to fill copy space, allowing them to see what a design would look like with some text, without being distracted by the words they used (unless of course you read Latin, in which case it'll likely give you a headache)

 * A random user generator

   Often when building a database, it can be helpful to have random data in the database, to make that development more real world. This generator creates random user data, requiring you to choose how many users to generate.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
